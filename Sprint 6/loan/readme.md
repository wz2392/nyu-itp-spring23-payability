# Step 6: Modification on loan
For this sprint, I calculated the [sum amount of loan by month](https://github.com/wz2392/nyu-itp-spring23-payability/blob/main/Sprint%206/loan/amount%20of%20loan%20by%20month.sql). And corrspondingly, also the [sum amount of statement by month](https://github.com/wz2392/nyu-itp-spring23-payability/blob/main/Sprint%206/loan/amount%20of%20statement%20by%20month.sql).
Based on the queries above, I used the Looker studio to build up the time series chart for these two metrics. Using different representitive colors and lables to directly shows the amount of loan and statement per month. The date range is the past two years.
For the whole page, the charts is validated by the data provided by Payability team. As the percentage of merchants who use the Amazon loan service is low, the validation still need more data.
