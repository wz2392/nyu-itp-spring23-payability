# Returns
## Modifications on the dashboard
For Return dashboard, as there are some overlap between return and refund table, we merged the return and refund togther. Apart from that, we created a new table chart with query [top 3 return item](https://github.com/wz2392/nyu-itp-spring23-payability/blob/main/Sprint%209/Returns/top3_return_item.sql).
In this query, the the table returns the primary key for that merchant, the exact return number for that item, the exact item name and the ASIN of that item.
