# New table and New dashboard: Returns
## Understanding of the new table
First, we do some search on the new table returns: it contains the data that related to return items from Anazon. Some key features are: A-to-Z Claim, Order Id, Return Type.
After the research, we created the data dictionnary for that table.
## New queries and new dashboard
The first chart is the table that shows [the most recent 3 records of returns](https://github.com/wz2392/nyu-itp-spring23-payability/blob/main/Sprint%208/Returns/latest_3_records_of_return.sql).
In this table we shows the latest 3 records of returns for one customer so that merchants can understand the current situation.

The second chart is the trend line of the number of the return items. Notice: in this chart, it represents the changing of [total number of return items](https://github.com/wz2392/nyu-itp-spring23-payability/blob/main/Sprint%208/Returns/total_returns.sql) not the return times.
