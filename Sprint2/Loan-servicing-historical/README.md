## First Step: Understanding the business model of Payability
# According to the introduction from Payability's team and my own investigation, the business model of Payability is:
Payability is a financial technology (FinTech) company that provides funding and payment solutions to small businesses, particularly those who sell on online marketplaces like Amazon, Walmart, and Shopify. Their business model centers around providing fast and flexible access to cash flow for these businesses, which often face long payment cycles from their online marketplaces.

Payability offers two main products: Instant Access and Instant Advance. Instant Access allows businesses to receive their marketplace payouts the next day, rather than waiting up to two weeks for funds to clear. Instant Advance provides businesses with a lump sum of cash based on their marketplace sales, which is repaid over time using a percentage of future sales.

In exchange for these services, Payability charges a fee or a percentage of the funding provided, depending on the product and the amount of funding needed. Overall, Payability's business model is designed to help small businesses manage their cash flow more effectively and grow their online sales without being limited by slow payment cycles.
